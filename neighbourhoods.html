        <p>The Plateau-Mont-Royal takes its name from its location on relatively flat terrain north of Sherbrooke Street and downtown, and east of Mont-Royal. It is the most densely populated borough in Canada, with 101,054 people living in an 8.1 square kilometre area.</p>

        <p>The downtown region houses many corporate headquarters as well a large majority of the city's skyscrapers — which, by law, cannot be greater in height than Mount Royal in order to preserve the aesthetic predominance and intimidation factor
          of the mountain.</p>
